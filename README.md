# Tic-tac-toe

After completing the [CodeCademy React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) course, I wanted to reinforce my knowledge of React by challenging myself to build a tic-tac-toe game without looking at any online sources. As tic-tac-toe was Bill Gates's Bill Gates's [first computer program](https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/13-surprising-facts-about-bill-gates/slidelist/46168221.cms), and since it is a kind of tradition for computer science students to build a tic-tac-toe game, I decided to make it with my newly-found knowledge of React. Completing this project was fun and challenging since I had to implement everything from scratch, and I didn't allow myself to look up online material even though I would run into some errors. However, doing that forced me to think creatively and helped me understand fundamental React concepts such as components, props, and states more practically.

## Lessons Learned

Since this was my first React project, I learned a lot about the structure of React projects, and I practiced React's [philosophy](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) of making everything modular and reusable.
Also, building this project helped me strengthen my knowledge of CSS and its Grid and Flexbox layout models.
